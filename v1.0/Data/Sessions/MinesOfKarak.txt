so that the portcullis cannot be raised from here orlocked in the down position.

This vast chamber features an arched ceiling supportedby massive carved columns. A portion of the ceiling hascollapsed, covering the floor here in wind-blown sandand creating an opening to the top of the basalt bluff.

10. Stables and Cart Storage
Dusty bones, rotting wood, and bands of rusted ironare scattered across the floor here. These are theremains of the wide-wheeled wagons once used tohaul ore shipments across the desert and the mulesthat pulled them. A scattering of blue scales showwhere the behir has made this area its lair.

11. Stable Master’s Quarters
This chamber was taken over by the Warden. Arough bed built of scavenged wood sits against onewall, while the gnoll’s filthy and foul-smelling gear isstrewn across the room.

12. Ore Storage
Ore from the mines was stored here and made readyfor transport. Though the area is empty, the dustof the floor shows where crates have been movedthrough here recently (Perception DC 12).

13. Entry Hall
This corridor once guarded entry into the fortress’sgreat hall. Footprints show where numerous creatureshave recently passed this way.

19. Northern Overlook
This defensive position commanded a view of thecourtyard below. Along its northern wall were thequarters of the mine-thane, the clan accountant, andthe head of the guard, as well as a private latrine. Thepersonal chambers have long since been stripped ofany valuables. As well as being easily defensible, this area is freeof the stench and squalor that fills much of the rest ofthe fortress. It makes a good place for the PCs to takean extended rest.

Dusty lumps of anthracite are scattered across thefloor here, a pair of rusted shovels set against the wall.

23. Guard Hal
lThis wide hall blocks access to the fortress’s lowerlevel with a portcullis controlled from the barracks.

24. Latrine

25. Barracks
The miners, crafters, and guards of the Karak Lodelived in this area, while the smaller side chamberhoused shift-captains. Six stone bunks stand here,

and chairs.

29. Dungeon
Four cells with barred portcullis doors are emptyexcept for stone cots and manacles set into the walls.
Set within the floor of one of the cells is the onlyentrance to the Karak Lode, but it cannot be detectedfrom this side as long as it is closed. See the “FoiledAmbush” tactical encounter (page 86) for moreinformation.

30. Storerooms
These chambers once held supplies for the maintenanceand upkeep of the fortress. A fine layer ofmoldy debris is all that remains

31. Crypts
The dwarves of Ironfell interred their dead here. Thevaults were half filled (mostly with victims of miningaccidents or folk who died in the desert) by the timethe mine was abandoned.
Tactical Encounter: Crypts (page 85).
The ancient halls of the Karak lode remain essentially
unchanged since the days of the dwarves.
 Illumination: Unless otherwise noted, there is no
illumination within the fortress.
Walls, Floors, and Ceilings: The interior spaces
of the fortress are constructed of close-fitted stone
(DC 20 to climb). Ceilings are 20 feet high except as
noted.
Portals: Rusted iron portcullises bar the way
into the fortress. See individual encounter areas for
specific information on raising and lowering the
portcullises.
 All doors within the complex are of sturdy wood
(Strength DC 16 to break open if locked).
 Except for the main gates (which are barred), all
the doors within the complex, as well as the portcullises,
can be opened or activated by the touch of
an Ironfell signet ring (a minor action). The curse
chanter in the “Foiled Ambush” encounter (page
86) carries an Ironfell signet ring, as does the real
Queen Shephatiah (the “Queen’s Retinue” encounter,
page 92).
Rot and Debris: With the exception of area 19,
much of the fortress has been given over to filth and
decay. Rubble and the dry-rotted remains of furniture
are spread across the floors, and the walls are stained
with condensation and mildew. In the year since
Karak was reoccupied, Shephatiah’s followers have
discarded rotten food and other filth in the areas they
do not inhabit.

THE BIRDMAN
When the PCs first explore area 29, they find one
of the cells with a prisoner recently captured by a
patrol.
This ancient dungeon shows signs of recent use, with scuff
marks along the floor indicating traffic in both directions.
Four large cells stand in the center of the chamber, the
entrance of each blocked by a lowered portcullis controlled
by a nearby winch and pulley. From the darkness
ahead comes a bright chirping sound.
The southwest cell is occupied by an aged human
male, his lined face sporting a snow-white beard to
match his fringe of hair. He wears the garb of a simple
desert peasant, and appears to have not been here
long. Seven yellow canaries perch on his shoulders
and hop around his cell. The Birdman whistles and
chirps at his tiny charges. If spoken to, he simply nods
and smiles.
 The prisoner offers no resistance and allows himself
to be led about by the PCs. If any survivors from
the fortress are questioned, they state that the Birdman
is a simple-minded peasant found wandering the
desert not far from Dunesend a few days before. He
was captured and brought here to feed the behir.
 The Birdman wanders those areas of the fortress
already cleared out by the PCs, hiding from any subsequent
combat. He accepts food and water if it is
offered, smiling if spoken to but otherwise ignoring
the party.
