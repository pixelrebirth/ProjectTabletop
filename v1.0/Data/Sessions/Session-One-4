# The Caves are the way out

The caves are blocked by rocks and rubble. There is mold and moisture surrounding on them and a foul stench of rot.
> Treacherous hazards will block the way including the following list:
    - Falling rocks
    - Steep dropoffs
    - Jumps
    - Undead Dwarves
    - Slippery rocks

You find a particularly well equipped dwarf

    - Arch de Triomphe Holds up a massive expanse of the cavern
    - Eifle Tower Tip is wedged horizontally in another part of the Cavern

    - Mona Lisa
    - Lamassu
    - Sphinx
    - Winged Victory

# Exiting the caverns

    - Require skill checks and difficult scaling out
    - A large beast (research) is near the exit which simply comes out of a ravine in the ground
