Asking villgers around near Lezumrim home in Sylbaran you quickly discover there is a house medani outpost just outside of town.

Sylbaran is a small town in the southern Eldeen Reaches, on the border of Droaam. It's position on the western tip of Silver Lake and its good soil make it ideal farm land. Its proximity to the monster nation and the harpy-infested Byeshk Mountains keep it from realizing its full potential though.

You find it surprisingly easy to enter into House Medani now that you are marked. You are welcomed, and asked your first names. Inside House Medani there is friendly banter and plenty of laughter. Asking around you find that the best person to talk to about getting work and money is Neva Ambrose.

Talking to Neva throws you a bit, she says to call herself "The Red Sash" ... The Red Sash's costume consists of a black tricorn hat, hair tucked into a headscarf mask, satin blouse, trousers, overcoat, and riding boots. Clad in black from head to foot, save for a red sash holding a rapier at her waist, she stands in profile-mysterious and forbidding.

In a slow rasping voice: "Who are you? Let me tell you straight that if you serve Breland, you will find your life lacks longevity."

She already had no love for the crown because of the stiff taxes placed on the neighborhood businesses, including her father's tavern. But she swore her revenge when her young beau was drafted into the king's service and died under the command of some foppish gentleman who ordered him on an unwarranted adventure. Now she rides the King's Road, exacting a bloody toll on agents of the crown. She periodically switches mounts, so she can't be identified by her horse.

"Let me tell you how you can help, you see that woman over there, her name is Palposu, she is a changeling, a flirt, and supposedly a Emerald Claw double agent. I need her dealt with, if she is who she claims, she may be an ally in finding out more about them. If she is a false double agent, we may be in serious trouble with her. Talk to Rithand and Thigraki about her to find out more. Do this and I will send a letter to the Baron to get you more visibility."

"and if you see fit to kill any corrupted brelish army personnel on the way I would be grateful..."

<it is common knowledge that Breland is a very good and strong powered country, she is the criminal, but for justified reason>

Rithand is very hurt and depressed. He is repetitive that she is a betrayer, but it is obvious he is hurt. He explains his side of the story:
Palposu pretended to love him to steal secrets from house medani, she admitted the fact she was an agent and that she was really in love with Thigraki.

Thigraki is very proud to have a woman of many fancies. He most definitely believes her and is madly entranced by her changing beauty. He believes Rithand to be dangerous to her.

Palposu will defend herself and say she is telling the truth. She will divulge information about her drop point and suggested we pursue it to show she is actually telling the truth.
The woman you are after is named Lana the Peace Bringer, an agent of the Emerald Claw. She swears the information she has divulged to them has been false.

Her next drop is in two days, where she admits she doesnt want to go. She fears Lana is on to her and will kill her.

He claims the half-elf is wicked and cruel. A warlord on a self-righteous crusade to provide Emerald Claw protection at all costs, mostly death.
Lana is a crime lord and frequents the Frinan's Delve as a hub for her criminal activity.

This walled castle has strong stone walls with towers. It appears deserted, but is inhabited by marauders led most likely by Lana the Peace Bringer

dungeon: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/84/bf/9584bf69a6355350ab3133100e1525c0.jpg
There is no magic here, which is odd. The doors are open and stuck that way. There are no patrols outside.

Upon fighting your way through traps and monsters, you will find Lana is screaming at a red headed dwarf is front of a mirror.. yelling that he is pathetic, and worthless... he is paralyzed with fear as he looks at the mirror.
She slams his head into the mirror and knocks him out cold. She proclaims, kindly all of a sudden, that he was not worth protecting anymore.

"He has no reason to live if he is afraid of mirrors. I will deal with him later, who are you? Do you come for protection? You will need it now."

Granter: 
    Information on the Emerald Claw (VERY LOW POSSIBILITY)
    Information on Palposu (One way, she will ease off, the other she will attack her more aggressively)
    Slips information on the corrupt officials in the city (Murasra)
Petitioner: 
    Information on House Medani
    Asks if you will neal to the Emerald Claw, she will trap you in the room either way

She is twisted into believing the Emerald Claw is the ultimate organization and oppose all that are not members.
She simply walks past them as she speaks and thanks them for cleaning up the rabble she has been meaning to in the castle. Attempts to stop her will result in a hold spell.

By looking to a way out, you will find a secret panel with treasure in it.

You will find a series of scratches in the book shelf that read \The walls listen\
Runes are carved into the side of the stone wall> A rowan tree withers and dies. (dc 20)

Eventually you will find a door: Section of wall pivots open when a command word (from runes) is spoken

There is no sign of Lana the Peace Bringer.
(if you like or need to kill more time in the game you could catch her near the enterance for battle and dialog)

Read:
Exiting the facility you suddenly get vertigo and collapse to the ground. As you hit the group you begin to fall as if the ground was not there. You fall through thin clouds and it is impossible to breathe. Forming below you is dark clouds that are expansive in all directions; as you cannot avoid it you plunge straight into the storm. 

Lightning, Hail, Snow, Huge Rain, Wind, and Tiny Cyclones surround you simultaneously.

You continue to descend and breaking through the storm you see desecrated land. Falling helpless you finally catch a breathe and can focus more. You cast spells on yourself to slow your descent and hover just 10 ft above the ground. You see living spells- a fireball in particular is perfectly developed with eyes and ears and nose and mouth of flames. The spell wanders around sifting through carcases looking for something.

The slow spell wears out faster than it should have and you fall the remaining distance to the ground with a thud. You look up to see the world is green and lush with trees of many vivid colors. Even the air smells incredible in this moment. You see a throne room with no walls in the middle of an open field. In it stands 5 figures with incredibly beautiful and masterfully crafted weapons and armor, one such figure takes his equipment off to reveal all 13 dragonmarks are upon his body, fully formed and intertwined. You cannot see their faces nor tell gender, aside from the man revealing his marks.

You sudden wake were you once fell to the ground from vertigo, just outside the keep you just exited.

Your house medani dragon mark grows and you now have the choice of:

Detect Magic per day or
Detect Poison per day or
Medani Helm of Hunting + 2

Group should discuss what the four dragon mark ranks are called for House Medani

Dragonmarks are not something that grow like this on people, they usually manifest themselves as birthmarks.

Returning back to the house medani building you will find that Palpasu and Thigraki have not returned from their, well date. <Palpasu has taken the form of Rithand and killed Thigraki.. she is seen as rithand with bloody blade being dropped in the woods as she runs away out of reach into the woods.>

Searching for Rithand will result in finding Rithand in a spike pit with bloody dagger in hand.
Searching for Palpasu you will find her on the outskirts of town, beaten and hardly breathing. <This is a guise until she can clearly get away>

This should lead to either an epic chase or an awesome investigation or a missed opportunity.
