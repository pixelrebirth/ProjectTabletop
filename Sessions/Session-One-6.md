## Camping and Travel

__"The night is upon us within a half hour. We should camp somewhere away from these ancient ruins of the human world."__

You find a place to camp that is safe and defendable, the great open sky for miles and the mysterious ocean waters below. The smell is fresh again and as the night passes more discussion about the humans occurs.

> Roleplay the camp site, what people choose to do with down time etc, decide what is next

Heading back to town is likely uneventful, roll 10+/6-/@5 or something bad will happen.

> Roll 10+ before 6- @5 unless 5 D1 Stirges will attack near the tunnels and the party must roleplay camp again.

## Returning to Raelgor

### On Dragons
Dragon Lore: __"Dragons are told to be the protectors of the world, but many of people believe they have malevolent intent. I have seen the blue dragon that roams Dhallmor, and even sought him out but with very little luck. It is told they do not interact directly with people."__

Interaction: __"Your interaction with the dragon is most interesting, but I have no additional information for you as I am simply not sure of anything more then what I have already told you."__

### On Stirges
Completed Task: __"Thank you for protecting the town, I have gathered the gear for you, I apologize that time has not been friendly to most of it."__

Give:
* Dented Medium Elven Warrior Armor + 1
* Tarnished Elven Hand Blade + 1
* Tarnished Elven Longsword + 2
* Elven Small Shield
* Brittle Elven Sling + 1

The Orb: "Ahh, you saw the orb. I have been there only once and I killed a queen there and attempted to kill as many cocoons as possible. That orb is a World Orb, it is told by the Shamans that their power holds the world afloat. Legend says the island could fall into the poisonous water below if it were to be destroyed, it is obvious to me that you left it alone, thank you for being wise."

```
```

### On Mrs. Fayette
__"Mrs. Fayette has been causing quite the trouble for herself since you were away, telling people what you told me, the mercanaries were enslaving the children, she even went to the lengths of burning down one of their outposts."__ 

__"She went to the port city of Milm Alora and struck a watchman that called her a liar and found herself in prison there. She was right to be angry, but I think a better approach is to get to the port city and find the mercanaries. We may be able to get them to stop taking our kids diplomatically, we should try."__

__"We do not need them coming after us and killing us to crush a possible rebellion. Please help Mrs. Fayette, she is a good woman."__

> Travel to the port city of Milm Alora with Compound Roll +5/-3/@6 else 3 D2 Dretches will attack you on the road

## Entering Milm Alora
You enter the gorgeous elven city of Milm Alora and see bustling merchants selling goods from the other islands. There are children in the streets playing with balls and many well made buildings as far as the eye can see. The city is warm and inviting.

As you reach a high point in the city you see a familiar tower in the distance, and realize that it was modelled after the ruins north of Thatelch. It is an incredible sight to see as dusk settles over the city.

> The party should seek out information where ever they choose


__"There isnt much you can do about that lad, the pretty portmaster is not available and his arsenal of ships is already on their way out for another run. They usually take about a few days to return."__

You settle into the thought of being here a while.

__"Maybe now is a good time to find work, get goods, and relax a while. Maybe we should check in on Mrs. Fayette? Not much we can do unless we plan on getting her out now?"__ -Ilboc
