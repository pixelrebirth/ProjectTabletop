## Camping and Travel

__"The night is upon us within a half hour. We should camp somewhere away from these ancient ruins of the human world."__

You find a place to camp that is safe and defendable, the great open sky for miles and the mysterious ocean waters below. The smell is fresh again and as the night passes more discussion about the humans occurs.

> Roleplay the camp site, what people choose to do with down time etc, decide what is next

Heading back to town is likely uneventful, roll 10+/6-/@5 or something bad will happen.

> Roll 10+ before 6- @5 unless 5 D1 Stirges will attack near the tunnels and the party must roleplay camp again.

## Returning to Raelgor

### On Dragons
Dragon Lore: __"Dragons are told to be the protectors of the world, but many of people believe they have malevolent intent. I have seen the blue dragon that roams Dhallmor, and even sought him out but with very little luck. It is told they do not interact directly with people."__

Interaction: __"Your interaction with the dragon is most interesting, but I have no additional information for you as I am simply not sure of anything more then what I have already told you."__

### On Stirges
Completed Task: __"Thank you for protecting the town, I have gathered the gear for you, I apologize that time has not been friendly to most of it."__

Give:
* Dented Medium Elven Warrior Armor + 1
* Tarnished Elven Hand Blade + 1
* Tarnished Elven Longsword + 2
* Elven Small Shield
* Brittle Elven Sling + 1

The Orb: "Ahh, you saw the orb. I have been there only once and I killed a queen there and attempted to kill as many cocoons as possible. That orb is a World Orb, it is told by the Shamans that their power holds the world afloat. Legend says the island could fall into the poisonous water below if it were to be destroyed, it is obvious to me that you left it alone, thank you for being wise."

```
```

### On Mrs. Fayette
__"Mrs. Fayette has been causing quite the trouble for herself since you were away, telling people what you told me, the mercenaries were enslaving the children, she even went to the lengths of burning down one of their outposts."__ 

__"She went to the port city of Milm Alora and struck a watchman that called her a liar and found herself in prison there. She was right to be angry, but I think a better approach is to get to the port city and find the mercenaries. We may be able to get them to stop taking our kids diplomatically, we should try."__

__"We do not need them coming after us and killing us to crush a possible rebellion. Please help Mrs. Fayette, she is a good woman."__

### On Milm Alora
__"So how are we going to get in Milm Alora? I went there a few years back with a few other cadets thinking we could find something to do and found that city to be locked down tight?"__ -Ilboc

__"Just a simple letter will get you all in. It is significantly harder to get out of Milm Alora than it is to get in. You will see things you will not understand inside, but this is the next step you must make in your journey. The world is far different than the humble elves and nomads you know. It is best you discover it for yourself without my opinions. The port cities are all a one way trip to keep the islands isolated from other places of the world. Seek out the mercenaries and stop them from fronting an attack on our supplies. While you are there I will put in for getting you passes out of the city. It takes some time but we cannot wait and risk getting cut off."__ says Raelgor

> Travel to the port city of Milm Alora with Compound Roll +5/-3/@6 else 3 D2 Dretches will attack you on the road

## Resistance at the Gate
You reach the massive wall surrounding the city and the small looking double metal reinforced door. There are two heavily armored and shielded elvish guards on duty. They are stoic and impressive.

__"You kids shouldnt be here. Milm Alora is not meant for you, it is a rough city at times and you can stumble on things not meant for immature minds."__ the guard says like an oft recited message.

Ilboc flashes the letter to the guard, who takes it with an inconvenienced look on his face. His mannerism to you change swiftly after reading it and says.

__"Let me be very clear to you, you will not be able to leave the city once you enter. You all need a pass to get out. This is how we protect the elves of this island from the evils of the rest of the world."__

## Entering Milm Alora
You enter the gorgeous elven city of Milm Alora and see bustling merchants selling goods from the other islands. The city is warm and inviting. 

You immediately realize that there are not just elves, humans and dwarves of this world. There is a large variety of races in fact, living dwarves, clean humans, and strange beast like races. There are children in the streets playing with balls and many well made buildings as far as the eye can see. It would seem having different races is no ordeal here as they share laughs and banter much the same as elves do between each other. This however doesnt settle well with your elvish sheltered mind. 

As you reach a high point in the city you see a familiar tower in the distance, and realize that it was modelled after the ruins north of Thatelch. It is an incredible sight to see as dusk settles over the city and airships come and go.

You notice behind you that elves are bringing in large barrels full of some kind of orange ore into the city, and other elves bringing large barrels of presumably food and supplies out of the city.

> The party should seek out information where it is available (lead them along to the Travel Cantina, play music)

__"There isnt much you can do about that lad, that pretty portmaster is not available and his arsenal of ships is already on their way out for another run. They usually take about a few days to return."__

You settle into the thought of being here a while.

__"Maybe now is a good time to find work, get goods, and relax a while. Maybe we should check in on Mrs. Fayette? Not much we can do unless we plan on getting her out now?"__ -Ilboc

## Travelers Cantina
Entering the Travelers Cantina you see many strange humanoids drinking and being loud. The music is loud and it is very unclear, one particular fellow is playing with a music box and approaching him you see a picture of (star wars) and a wind up music box with the song playing on it. The room is ruccus and it feels as if a fight will break out.

The humanoid with a squid face says: (aaron your up)

## The Errands
Option 1:
Acquire the Book of Scars from Yesmand of the city library. I need it to finish my new medicine and I can give you 200 gold for the task, more if you have the trouble I anticipate you having.

* Yesmand will play dumb, and recognize that Killik asked you
* Yesmand will accidentally tip that it is here, but not tell you where it is
* You will need to find a way to locate the book.

You will have to find a clever way to find the book. If you threaten or attack him guards will be sent and you will unlock the Mrs. Fayette Prison Scene as you are in jail in a cell a few down from her. Play out jail rescue and break out mission. Or possibly see if the party is interested and seeing if this becomes a way into the 

Option 2:
There are rats in the sewers near my home. Huge grotesque rats that come out and eat my food. Find and kill the nest and I will reward you with a solid shield my father gave me.

You will notice there is underground activities of less than stellar humanoids you dont want to mess with.

Option 3:
Seek out Mrs. Fayette and fail to gain access to her. No reward.

Option 4: Skip the extras and do something ad hoc.
