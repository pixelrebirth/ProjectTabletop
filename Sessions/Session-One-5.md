## Onward to Phialas
Finally, you exit the ravine of Thatelch Delve. The dwarves dug deep and discovery an ancient city buried in the stone walls of Dhallmor. The curse destroyed the elves and while the dwarves of Thatelch did not blame the elves, the king did, the curse was in fact spawned by unearthed history. This history, dark and mysterious had animated solid carved stone, buried massive structures and corrupted the living to continue an unresolved undeath.

As you trek away from the final battle against the one winged headless statue and her dwarvish undead minions, you begin to smell fresh air again and see the sun just hours away from setting on the horizon. You turn to look behind you and you see a massive structure and bridge. The structure has arches on the bottom and is made out of layers of metal hatched together. The top clearly broke off at one point and you are reminded of what the metal looked like of the structure holding the cavern open.

Most other directions you look are just hills and plains, aside from the buried golden arches in the opposite direction of the tower.

## Those damned double arches
As you come closer to the arches you see flashes of a ringmail and spear clad warrior lamenting something at the arches. There is no trinkets, nor armor nor weapons here. There is skulls and unusual two headed ravens. You see something glint in the sunlight on top of one of the arches.

As you approach the arches, the smell begins to settle as foul rot. The blood sacrificed here is dry but some of the animal tissue on the ground is still fresh.

The subtle glint is from a gemstone lodged into the pale yellow soft material. Prying at it you break it loose only to discover it is an ancient amulet, probably lodged in the arches with reasonable force.

Stepping back you are slammed with the illusion of a horrible storm and the arches sliding down what seems like a road. There are unknown buildings and more metal squares with wheels. There are people screaming as the earth splits and several portions of the earth are cresting like an ocean waves. The ground is rising is some places and falling in others. As the earth crests over top of you the arches catch velocity and rocket out of the opening just before the earth crushes you whole...

Stunned you see the warrior again, looking longingly at a skull on the ground. He says without looking.
__"You have woken it, you have found it, you have the power to see it"__ He then takes an amulet off his neck and throws it at the arches in the place you found it. The warrior says __"I can finally be rid of this sight and rest, it is your burden to bear, use it were I could not."__ The apparition vanishes, and the two headed ravines cock their heads, perplexed you are not dead as well.

Thum strikes out and says __"That was Denethor, and Old King of Thatelch. He was a great dwarf, kind hearted and all knowing of the past, more then anyone else. It was once told in tales that illness would become of him if he were to leave the accompanyment of that very amulet."__

__"I wonder what its purpose is, what could it possibly mean to have the gift of ancient sight of doom and chaos. Why would this cause us ill."__ -Ilboc
