> This amulet is part of a set of 3 that will need to be found in order to control the dimension gates predictably. These amulets will basically call the party to them, much like the double arches did. Each giving one of the three visions:
* the destruction of the human world
* the world before the destruction 
* the advent of the movie and television dimensions

The world orbs will begin to fail, starting with the next uninspiring island they come across, each world orb will close one of 13 dimensions forever.
Portal room will reveal itself like a compass on a specific small island once the amulets are found.

Each portal will lead to a TV, Movie, or Book universe where you will need to follow the combined amulet to a clue of where the world shard is
These world shards will open a portal to the levels of legendary, demigods, and gods alike where you will battle evil and restore the unity of the world and then break the interdimensional time holes.

Defeating these will restore the world to modern day, where you will be transformed one last time into the person playing OpenLore. Character becomes Player.
One tiny interdimensional world shard rests in front of you. What will become of you now?
