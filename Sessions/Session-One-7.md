## On to the portmaster
You gain an EXP for the last adventure session.

You find out from the tavern that the portmaster, Julian, is going to be at the airship port today.
Naturally you pursue him to find out why he has been aiding the mercenaries.

You reach the skydocks and see a huge platform in the sky a full square block in size. It is adorned with steam engines and bronze plated statues.
The floor is wood and the whole structure is supported by several metal strucks that drive into the slums below.

The docks are full of activity and it hard to discern the pattern of the chaos. There are people loading and unloading, there are people lost, and people moving quickly.
There are many strange races, just as we say down below, but most seem civil, aside from the group arguing at a tall and symetrical elf with crossbow slung over his shoulder.

The elf doesnt seem agressive, but seems firm in his dealings with the angry men yelling at him about port fees and docking orders.
This is definitely the port master, but he is not as despicable as you might have imagined.

__"What can I do for a group of young elves, surely do make this quick, I see airships coming into port. You have until they arrive to talk. Name's Julian."__ 

He outreaches a hand to shake. You are surprised by his kindness. Pushing him on the subject of his betrayal to Dhallmor kids will make him stammer back and rebuttle.

__"How do you kids know about this? We cannot talk here. You shouldnt know about that and are in danger. Let me finish docking these last few airships for the day and we can talk. You can stay with me if you prefer to know I am not tricking you. It is not going to be good news you hear, however."__

You wait for about 30 minutes with Julian in your sights. Watching him help the workers of the docks do the sequences needed to dock massive flying ships.
It is fascinating to watch the orchestration, but you are puzzled by Julian... you are curious what he could possibly say.

Julian frequently looks back to make sure you are still around. Pointing to the various ships to signal approximate time remaining.

__"The day is done... let us go now, you choose a quiet place and we can go there."__ says Julian calmly.

You notice a wedding ring on his finger as you walk to a good spot. Julian looks over his shoulder in several directions once you reach where the party decided to talk.

__"Seems this is a good spot out of mercenary eyes. You shouldnt know what the mercenaries are doing... These men are vicious, trained from youth to be violent. They control the skys and all the ports of the islands as far as we understand. If you dont do as they ask, or betray them they begin to strike back. There is already an uproar about a woman that I heard was causing noise about this very topic. The mercenaries have been more active than usual since then. Many years ago they setup a long standing trade agreement with the last port master, the late Minus Tarvales, my predecessor whom passed away just 3 months ago. That agreement is the only thing keeping goods coming to this island. While I do not agree with this trade, I do believe it is worth it to get access to all the goods of the world. I am pulling you aside to warn you, consider yourself lucky to be rejected and make a new path for yourself. I too was rejected 10 years ago, and knowing what I know now I feel lucky too. I only within the last few months realized this was even occurring. Take your luck and strive to be something better, but I ill advise you to seek the leader of the mercenaries. He is cruel and powerful, it will be your death. It will also lead to many lives being endangered on this island as shipments stop for months and they arrive with galleys full of armed troops to cut down our weakened state."__

You are stunned by this story, simply because you were naive enough to think you would get more resolution from this elf. His honest and calm nature feels truthful and genuine. Unless you have a way to convince him, he will be of no help at this point.

> Unless you uncover something along the way about his family he will not help you and you will have to find another way to get information. If this becomes a dead end, Ilboc will mention his family to spark conversation about it. Julian will not be comfortable about his family and rightly admit that he doesnt want his family to know.

After the conversation has convinced Julian to help, he will divulge more details.

__"The guilt has been horrible, and hiding this from my family worse knowing that my own kids will grow up. It just hasnt been the time. Maybe it is better to fight with a guilt free conscience than cower with a guilty one. I will help you and inform my family of this to rid myself of this aweful guilt. I just didnt see a way yet. You may not succeed, but maybe it will start a revolution. We need to be certain we have ships commandeered before we act. There is a ship called the Forgotten Bystandard... it is docked on the wall getting repairs on the western edge of town. It should be nearly done."__

__"You can 'steal it' and I will not send anyone after you. That is all I can do for you, I truly hope you start something without getting us all killed. The only high ranking officer I am aware of is a man named Phialas and he resides on the island of Nargan 5 days travel to the South East. He is a pretty boy officer with the mercenaries and oversees the acquisition of the kids yearly here. He is heavily protected and you will need to be prepared. I dont recommend going after him immediately. Seek more information first. I cannot give you many other tips, as I have never been off this island myself. I wish you luck for the sake of my own children. I can now tell my wife, knowing I tried to help the problem."__

## The Interstellar Chair
You spend what feels like all afternoon making your way to the other side of Milm Alora and reach the wall at the edge of the island. The wall extends 100-150ft away from the cliff edge. The view is incredible from the edge of the island, and that waters below peek through a hole in the clouds. The body height railing does not feel like enough to keep you from falling to your death as vertigo quickly setting in to those susceptible. Clear as day there is a small airship docked at the very tip of the wall, that must be the Forgotten Bystandard. You seem men and orcs working near the ship. The sun is going down for the day and the works seem to be wrapping things up for the day.

> Ask for how they want to approach the airship, if they are risky or stupid (lose 3 before 6 @ 8), enter combat with 3 Normal Guards

You sneak onboard the ship and mimic what the port hands were doing on the docks earlier today to release the ships. The controls are simple and effortless. With a considerable amount of shaking, the ship pulls away from port and moves away from island. The guards of the docks come running and shooting arrows are you, but to little avail. You follow the compass toward the South East.

> Aaron will wander into the navigation deck where the party is and introduce himself.

You are sailing happily along the path and the party enters what looks to be a small common area. Inside the room is a small nice table with mounted stools around it and a nice comfy looking dark wood chair by itself in the corner. 

> Rick should take over here with Alvin Timbershanks.

Q: Who are you?
A: My name is Alvin Timbershanks, last guardian of the Ebowyn.

Q: What do you want?
A: I’ve been searching for that amulet 3,746 years, galactic standard time.

Q: why do want the Amulet?
A: Don’t you know what you have? That amulet is the key to the galaxy. With that Amulet you can open the portal and instantly travel to another planet.

Once I have that amulet I will finally be able to free the galaxy from the False Gods. The portals are how the False Gods travel, it will finally lead to them.

Q: False Gods? What the heck?!
A: Who do you think the Mercenaries work for? They are scourge on the Galaxy.

They are beings of immense power and scarce mercy. They move through the galaxy enslaving worlds, stripping them of their beauty and resources. All in an attempt to become the most powerful beings in the universe. They pretend to be divine gods, and have created fanatical a following.

In reality they are humans who stole the secret of eternal health from my people. Right before they burned my planet to the ground so one else would ever challenge them. They thought they extinguished my people, but I survived. Now I hunt them, till the end of time if need be.

## Pirate of the Air
The flight to Nargan has been mostly peaceful albeit long. Most of you having grown up on a 30 mile island, you are not accustomed to travelling for such long durations at a time. Boredom and hunger settle in as the food storage supplies were not really a consideration when stealing an airship. The supplies will last, as they were rationed at the start of the trip for the 5 day journey. As you are currently enjoying a game of Humans and Houses, a roleplaying game where you get to pretend to be the ancient humans, you sudden hear a shattering boom on the surface of the ship. You are under attack and run to the combat stations available. There are 3 magic cannons hard mounted with a 45 degree swivel in each direction of the ship aside from the stern. From previous experimentation from a few days past, you know that it is possible to shoot one shot approximately every 10 seconds. One person must steer, totaling a max crew of 4 manning the ship.

You can see the other ship using a mounted spy glass, they seem to have larger cannons, but only on the port and starboard sides of the ship. They also seem to be faster yet less manueverable in turning than your ship.

Start combat, they have the first turn, as they have already done your ship 10 damage and ripped an ice hole in the edge of the deck through the side of the ship.

> You are now in the inaugural 3d combat system of OpenLore. One ship vs One ship in three dimensional space.
