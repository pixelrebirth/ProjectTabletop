## Entering Nargan
The barren island of Nargan on the horizon surprises you with a lower level of resistance from the Mercenaries than expected. They must be on the island somewhere, but it is hard to tell. You throw the anchor some 100 ft below and the loud rattle of 6 inch thick steel clanking on the hull is piercing until it settles below. You shift the ship forward and dig the anchor into the ground. You locate the ships rope ladder and unravel a hundred feet of it to the ground. The dock hand, naturally, goes to the bottom and secures the ladder taught and dug into the ground.

You have arrived in a valley with not much more then a trickling stream. In the far distance you see a large metal building, rotted and corroded. As you approach the building you realize it is most definitely an ancient ruin of some sort in the shape very similar to the airship... this airship was made out of browned metal, this is something you have seen before called rust, but know very little about. The gapping hole does not look intentional and you suspect that the airship crashed due to a significant magic burst in the hull.

As you approach the crashed metal airship, you realize the scale of it is much larger than it seemed from a distance. This ship is like a city, a sad and broken city. Once you reach the airship you keep your ears keep but do not hear much more then a few birds that fly above you. On the horizon you begin to make out more structures that seem like a giant parellel red tower with large metal ropes hanging from them. The towers supported something in the past, but now it looks broken. There is red structures strewn about from one mountain to another. These ancient humans were very adept builders, but whatever happen to them truly obliterated everything they built.

## The Carrier of Nargan
The curiosity of exploring the carrier is too great, and the party decides to enter the potentially dangerous structure.

### 5 rooms 

1. A captains quarters, looted and lived in but not recently, there is a locked panel in the captains desk with four buttons a skull, a flame, a key, and a door. Every incorrect action has a consequence, 1> A click in the dresser, maybe an additional lock 2> The door slams shut and locks, it was spring loaded 3> Liquid will begin to slowly fill the room out of port holes in the 4 walls, but it is not water, it is thick and murky. 4> Flames will begin to come out of the walls
2. The hanger bay, full of broken winged metal with massive complex parts, fins, blades, and gears. There are two lights floating in the air and as soon as you see them they shine brighter and start absorbing a flurry of metal shards, gears, panels, blades, and forms into metal men. Both come at you with speed. Another orb forms into a catapult of shrapnel adn stay at a distance. (2x D3, 1x D2 catapult)
3. You find what looks to be a weapon room with ancient dismantled weapons, bins full of random parts, many of which appear broken, jammed, or rotting. In this same room there is a locked chest however that is not in as bad a shape. (Inside the party can have one thing of their choosing each, max is what is on the GM table.)
4. The tower is an incredible structure and it looks like the mercenaries are spending considerable time there. As you navigate up the tower you see evidence there has been someone here recently, a fresh muddy track and the smell of a campfire.
5. The final room is at the top of the tower and you get a clear view of the island. There is no one around and the fire was recently put out and still slightly simmering. You peer out over the horizon and see there is troop movement of some kind near the red metal structures.

> Gain 1 EXP for investigating ancient ruins and surviving the pirate battle, the party should strategize how they want to approach the next situation. If they take them on, they will be able to extract information, if they let them go and follow them, they will simply end up at Alcatraz but not find Phialas.

Encounter:
4 NPCS.

## The Golden Gate Bridge People
Magnificent dark red towering structures shrouded in crystalline glass looms on the horizon. The bridge looks built by ancient humans to cross some sort of chasm. Soft sands rise from the valley onto the mid-mountain range with forests topping them. The depth of the valley impresses you. The formation of the sands on the mountainside cause speculation this bridge crossed over water in the ancient world. A moment of hesitation creates uncertainty, causing you to stammer in your progress. You suddenly snap out of the haze remembering the mercenaries recently walked through the crystals without harm. You proceed cautiously, finding dark-skinned elves hauling massive amounts of dirt from a cave system at the base of the bridge gatehouse.

### The Drow Excavators
A dark-skinned drow watches the stream of workers, calling to them when they make misguided decisions on how to handle the various earthly shards extracted from the mountainside. She doesn't seem alarmed that you approach her.

_"You don't seem like the typical rabble that land on this island. State your business? People call me Dell, a nickname of Delhia."_

#### Asking of the Mercenaries
_"The prison on the mountain, go there to discover whom you seek. A warning, however, the man that rules that place ruthlessly kills those that oppose him. Marin tells me the traps on the hill leading to the prison viscously injury unaware prey. Speak to Marin when you return in our newly completed tunnel, he led the drow through many difficult times."_

#### Gathering knowledge of the Mining
_"We pull the dirt from this cave every day trying to open passage to the ancient tunnels. The discovery of the tunnel on the other side of the ruined city leads us to our home. We dig here to add another escape out of the underground city of Arvon. This new entrance to the city vitally connects our people to the rest of the world through the airport without further travel. Come back later today to see us open the tunnels. Come join us to enjoy a drink."_

## The Portal Temple (Alcatraz)
The prison hill stands high in the middle of the valley. Layers of sharp fencing seem to wrap the base on the mountain in the middle of the valley of shards. Evidently, the mercenaries enter the compound somewhere, it simply needs locating.

Arrows rain from above you, plinking in the grass in front of you. You run in the direction that makes the most sense. Arrows seem to come into the path of every direction you run. You run opposite of the hill to distance yourself from the longbow shots. Suddenly the gut-wrenching feeling of falling overcomes you; with a thud, you collide with the stone below. A ceiling door of bars swings to close the gap left above.

In the tunnel, you see long-running metal rails on the ground going in one direction. Rocks, boulders, long thick support structs block the path in the other direction.

> The party likely searches a path out. They discover a way out if they simply muscle a metal door open. Roll a 5 on search, a 10 on opening unassisted, a 6 if assisted.

The door swings open with a loud crash. The roaring of a foul creature echoes its response to the noise. You proceed into a tunnel no longer made by man. Sharp jagged rocks jut out from the edges of the roughly hewn walls. You continue to enter deeper into the cave system reaching an expansive cavern below the surface.

Defeating the worm renders your body weak. The hot pool in the distance radiates steam from it.

You notice a path with light coming in on the far side of the cavern. You approach cautiously, moving out of the caves with care. No arrows fall from the sky. No guards near the opening. The light pierces your slowly adjusting eyes. Far in the distance the prison mountain looms ominously like a forboding cloud.
