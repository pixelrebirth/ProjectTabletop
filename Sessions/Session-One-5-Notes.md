As you leave the ravine in the ground and the shards of the one winged statue.
You will see a huge standing rushed metal frame, the same metal as the strange metal beams holding up the cavern.

### Something interesting should happen at the arches
Maybe a flashback to the past like your dreams
See moments of the destruction of the human world

Reward with the medium armor of quality 1, and a sword of quality 1, a shield of quality 1, and a sling of quality 2
"Apologies, time has not favored this gear"

He does not know about the dragon, or the dwarves, or the arches, but will answer those questions as best as possible.


### What of Mrs. Fayette



### What happened to the port master to turn so corrupt?
The port master has been helping the mercanaries in an attempt to save lives.
Over the years he has become accustomed to lying about his work to his family. 
He does not willfully admit he has a family, but he does, uncovering this would be kryptonite.

He wears a ring on his wedding finger.

The port master believes he is doing right by keeping the mercanaries staffed with the kids from Dhallmor as to prevent outright slaughter by them.
He strongly believes the trade of forceful mercenary workers for food, supplies, and the lack of a smackdown is worth it.
He will not be convinced otherwise from this point, it is too deeply seeded in his mind, only knowledge of his family can change his mind.

The party must figure out his weakness and step on it to get him to talk about Phialas and where to find him.

Later:
He will know the location of where Phialas is headed, the human inhabitted Island Nargan. He will also help you by giving you access to a beat up airship.


## Villian
Name: Phialas
Motivation: To remain beautiful and desired by woman
Race: Human
Difficulty: 5
Protected by Difficulty: 3-4 henchmen (Humans)
Commands Elf Minions: 2

He will get away easily when they party is dispatching the henchmen, but he will ensures that supplies will be cut off.
He heads off to the nearest airship, but the party cannot catch him, but they can highjack another smaller, slower airship.
Several airships follow Phialas' airship, even those inbound.
