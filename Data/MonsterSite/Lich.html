<span class="monstername">LICH</span>

<p class="bodytext">A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer but sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who has used its magical powers to unnaturally extend its life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones. Its eyes have long ago been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on
in the empty sockets.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">CREATING A LICH</p>
<p class="bodytext">&ldquo;Lich&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required phylactery; see The
Lich&rsquo;s Phylactery, below.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A lich has all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Size and Type:</span> The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Hit Dice:</span> Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Armor Class:</span> A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus, whichever is better.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Attack:</span> A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round. If the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural
weapons. A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Full Attack:</span> A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its
primary attack along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Damage:</span> A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that uses negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich&rsquo;s HD +
lich&rsquo;s Cha modifier) halves the damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra
damage on one natural weapon attack.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Special Attacks:</span> A lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich&rsquo;s HD + lich&rsquo;s Cha modifier
unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Fear Aura (Su):</i> Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected as
though by a <i><a href="../spells/Fear.html">fear</a></i> spell from a sorcerer of the lich&rsquo;s level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich&rsquo;s aura for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</i> Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. <i><a href="../spells/Remove_Paralysis.html">Remove paralysis</a></i> or any spell that can
remove a curse can free the victim (see the <i><a href="../spells/Bestow_Curse.html">bestow curse</a></i> spell description).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 <a href="../skills/SPOT.html">Spot</a> check or a DC 15 <a href="../skills/HEAL.html">Heal</a> check reveals
that the victim is still alive..</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Spells:</i> A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Special Qualities:</span> A lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special qualities and gains those described below.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Turn Resistance (Ex):</span> A lich has +4 turn resistance.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Damage Reduction (Su):</span> A lich&rsquo;s undead body is tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Immunities (Ex):</span> Liches have immunity to cold, electricity, polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Abilities:</span> Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no <a href="../basics/CONSTITUTION.html">Constitution</a> score.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Skills:</span> Liches have a +8 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/HIDE.html">Hide</a>, <a href="../skills/LISTEN.html">Listen</a>, <a href="../skills/MOVE_SILENTLY.html">Move Silently</a>,
<a href="../skills/SEARCH.html">Search</a>, <a href="../skills/SENSE_MOTIVE.html">Sense Motive</a>, and <a href="../skills/SPOT.html">Spot</a> checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Organization:</span> Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2&ndash;4 vampires and 5&ndash;8 vampire spawn).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Challenge Rating:</span> Same as the base creature + 2.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Treasure:</span> Standard coins; double goods; double items.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Alignment:</span> Any evil.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Advancement:</span> By character class.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytitle">Level Adjustment:</span> Same as the base creature +4.</p>
<p class="bodytext">LICH CHARACTERS</p>
<p class="bodytext">The process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be undertaken only by a willing character. A lich retains all class abilities it had in life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">THE LICH&rsquo;S PHYLACTERY</p>
<p class="bodytext">An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in which the character stores its life force. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery.
Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the <a href="../feats/CRAFT_WONDROUS_ITEM.html">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat. The character must be able to cast spells and have a caster
level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a
break DC of 40.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items.</p>
