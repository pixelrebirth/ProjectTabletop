# The Mercenaries Guild

### Waiting in Line

Finally, you have almost completed your training. It was mostly just paperwork and push ups, but on this day you are complete and you can start making money enough to get off this retched island. You've lived here from birth into adulthood and you want nothing more then to explore the distant floating islands on the horizon.

The time you have spent preparing to leave has been growling, but leaving this podunk village island seems to be every child's dream around here. Most of the other young adults have dropped out of the program and are choosing to seek other methods to get off the island. You have stuck in out for years now in preparation for you final test.

You have been ask to battle a Bulette in singles combat to prove you are ready for what is next. The fields of Eran is an area of the island few people go because of the underground creatures.

__"Can you believe they actually caught one of these beast? They are amazing at what the mercenaries can do with their airships, their magic, and look at how nice his pocket watch is?!? He must be loaded in coin."__ said Bigley to the bored and barely moving group of people in line. __"I've heard three of the seven people ahead of us almost died; they were just idiots though, right? ...right?"__

Bigley, an old and loyal friend, will not stop talking and it is making the day long wait painfully tedious to manage. People snap at him to shut up, but he is quiet for only a few minutes.

Ilboc has had enough of the arguing to get him to be quiet and takes Bigley just outside the line and tells him something in his ear. When he comes back to line he is perfectly quiet.

Of course, even a bribe cannot stop Bigley from his nerves and he starts blathering about the sharpness of the Bulette's teeth, the quickness they can dig, the hardness of their rock like natural plate mail, and the imminent death that will become of us. He boasts he knows how to kill them and says you have to hit the bottom of their feet. He is very confident but you can tell his confidence is just a guise. Bigley is doomed unless you can convince him otherwise.

* _[DC 25] mind-comm to convince him otherwise_

Bigley is called up next and he goes in with his shortsword and standard issue studded leather armor... and now you wait.

> __This is a good time to talk about the world premise.__ _Rumour about how the world came to be and the abstract ideas of the humans. (Add both myth and reality) Start with, `I heard`_

### The Challenge

One by one you are called up to kill the Brulette...

- Minion Brulette Defender

Easily defeated you arrive in the bunker where you would have anticipated seeing the rest of your peers, instead you see a simple table, a plate of food and a washing area. _(RP)_
Eating after the battle and all the waiting, feels absolutely delightful and upon finishing a well groomed beastly red headed man comes into the room to congratulate you into Reenig's Mercanaries.

He walks you into a separate room where he asks you to wait, something is unsettling however. It was not supposed to be so easy to get into the guild.
The rest of what remains of the group eventually arrives with you where you have time to gossip, sharing stories about yourself on the island.

The burly red headed man arrives at last to brief you on the current state of your rank, Recruit.
He explains that you are required to take each mission without question and you will not be paid anything until after you have left on an airship.


__"You will not be granted access to any additional missions until you have successfully completed the mission you are current on. There is no failures. Your first mission is to replenish our stock of Brulettes. We will expect them to be subdued when we arrive with the airship in 2 hours."__


A door automatically opens leading out of the facility.
As you leave, __"I recommend talking to that map maker you have in your shitty little village, he can probably help you find your way."__

He laughs with a deep belly laugh.

### Map Maker
You go to town to discover the map maker named Olivat.

> __This is a good time to create the island map with the following features__

Map maker - build the island design
- One village
- One port town
- Two caves
- One fort
- One sizeable field/plains (Eran)
- 3 land features
- One human landmark

### In the Fields
Once you reach the fields of Eran you will see very little but scattered holes in the ground.
As you gather the courage to venture closer to the holes and tunnels you hear nothing at all.

> Roleplay and make sure they find absolutely nothing useful. 

You see the merchant airship approaching you... (_RP_) it passes as men and woman stare at you from above.

__"Did we just fail our test?" -says Ilboc__

On the way out of the field of Eran there is a few Dretches near the mouth of the forest, one of them sizably larger then the other two.

- Brutal Elite Generalist
- Minor Dretch Sharpshooter
- Minor Dretch Sharpshooter

### Bigley Gets Cut

As you go back to town Bigley, exhausted chases you down.
__"Wait! Wait! I was terribly wrong.."__

He is in sheer panic and pale as a ghost. Upon asking him what?

__"It's the Mercenaries, they aren't who they say. The others are dead.. or taken. You are all the rejects, planned to make it seem as if you didnt make it in. The Port Master is working with them and enslav.... I escaped just bare...."__ 

He falls in a lump to the ground with a dart in his spine.
His veins go black and he pukes up blood...

__"Maybe we should talk to the village headman tomorrow. We should also inform Mrs. Fayette of her sons passing."__

### Talking with Mrs. Fayette

"Oh hello boys! Did you make it into the Mercenaries? Ive been so anxious to find out what happened all day? I made cake! Let me get it..."
She turns to go back inside and stops in her tracks.

"Where's Bigley...?"

She will fall into a ghastly figure hearing the news. Hardly a tear, just speechless shock. She... barely being able to speak says, 
__"Im going to kill them.. take this. Take everything in that chest, I cannot bear to have it. Leave me a blade."__
__"Please tell the headman tomorrow. Im going to kill every last one of them myself. .. you all should leave."__

> [DC 30 MIND-COMM - will change her mind]

The chest is filled with various equipment, each roll on the treasure chart.
