# The Greatest of Caves in Dhallmor

### Leaving Mrs. Fayette's House
Mrs. Fayette's ghastly white form from hearing the news her son is dead, has been overtaken by redness, rage, and a near uncontrolled desire to leave right this instance to kill them.

__"It would be much wiser to wait until you have a plan Mrs. Fayette, we can help you after we talk to the headman."__

She continues to insist that she should leave right now to get revenge.

__"They need to die for what they have done to all the children over the years. Bigley---- he was so kind and wanted nothing more then to..... slavery? They killed him for it."__

After some time she will calm down to realize that as a group they can be more successful.
The hour is growing late and Mrs. Fayette seems to want to be alone for the rest of the evening to wallow. 

__"We should get some rest, tomorrow is going to be no less confusing a day than today was. I feel like we should be reporting in to the mercaneries tomorrow.. like we have for so long already. I can't believe we wasted so much time getting ready for our tests... for it to be all wrong. I almost dont believe any of this is true. Ive always heard there methods of letting people know they were not accepted were cruel and all, but poor Bigley... he may have been annoying but he had no reason to lie with a poison dart in his spine. We should sleep at the inn rather than go home tonight, just in case. Go home and tell your family a reason we must keep safe. Meet at The Old Wench's Tavern at 9 oclock."__ says Ilboc.

Each party member will be going home, wherever that is. Ilboc will be going home to his fiance Aloia and stop by to see his father Ranui Bairnell. Each person should talk about there home life situation and write in notes for the character sheet.

> This should take a moment to create minor backstory relevant to current living situations.

### Trouble with the Help

You arrive at _The Old Wench's Tavern_ almost at the same time. The weather has suddenly turned colder than usual, this is a sign that one of the ice dragons may be watching over the night. Dragons are never sinister nor interfering, they fly ominously in the distance carefully watching the islands from afar. The locals have come to recognize some of them by the effects they have on the environment. These dragons, some believe are just a myth, while most others claim they are easy to see if you know where to look. Ilboc looks to the sky feeling like he might be able to get a glimpse of the dragon himself, but there is no dragon to be seen.

Once inside the tavern, you realize that it is surprisingly packed with very little space to sit. Most of the people are celebrating with each other and bragging about their kids who finally made it into The Mercenaries. These people are all well into the booze already, some are nearly passed out drunk.

* The people in the inn are too sloshed and happy to be bothered by bad news, if pushed they will start to make fun of you for not making it in.

In the corner sits a brooding man, sitting lazily in a chair with a distinct slouch and relaxed demeanor. It is Adel'rah, an old acquaintance, one of the rejected from the mercenaries last year.

__"I see there are more rejects then normal this year. The Mercenaries must have been full. Did you get sent out to kill rats too? What does it matter, you are stuck here just like I am now. Might as well adapt whatever lifestyle you can here. I have chosen to be a treasure hunter you see."__ 

He is calm, collected and unsurprised to hear about the treachery afoot. He is also accommodating and believing. He redirects attention to something he is interested in.

__"Have you heard about the legendary Giant Grinder. A human hermit claimed it is supposedly a dwarf weapon. Whatever a Dwarf is? They all died suddenly in the great wall fort Thatelch, it is told in legend. No one has been able to get in for centuries it is told. I have reason to believe I know how to get in, but I need help doing so. Im leaving in the morning to see what I find there with or without help."__

He will be disinterested in helping with the mercenaries prior to going to Thatelch's Delve to hunt down the legendary weapon called the _Giant Grinder_ and kill the undead supposedly protecting the weapon. 

> At anytime: If the party decides to instead follow the port master thread, they will only find reports of him being gone with the mercenaries for a few weeks as a regular occurrence.

Today has not gone well and it seems that no one is willing to listen. You are exhausted at this point and decide to sleep it off.

### Dreams of Strange Adventures

You dream heavily on this night once you finally fall asleep. Dreams of random chaos at times, of being slaves, of being murdered, and at times strange dreams of ancient origin. Dreams of metal boxes with wheels rusted on the side of a wide heavily cracked black path with bushes and grass growing out of it, and dreams of huge structures overgrown by millennia of fauna. 

This night is cold and crisp, almost winter like in summer. You wake up at times in a cold sweat, but not at the same time as the others. You sleep easily enough again and dream more of seeing the dragons fly and magic fantastic places. These surges of dreams are new to you.

> Each player should describe a few modern images but in a post-apocalyptic and thousand year old way. The dream is not of the past, but of the present condition of ancient locations. They should be described in a way that is not understood. Take notes, this is great content for future games.

### Talking to the Headman

The village headman will not be readily available upon request. His guards will need to be convinced somehow to let you in to see him about the mercenaries.

* The guards will require some kind of proof or evidence of the treachery you speak of.

Being escorted into the small building leads into an entry way with a large table with a statue of an elf slaying a Stirge with an elven blade. The detail is exquisite and the stone is smooth and polished.

An old man quietly comes up to you and says, (in an old gruff voice)

__"My younger years were very kind to me. It is the age and the time that makes me feel so very frail at 140 now. I was just 30 then when I slayed the Stirges that ravaged our city from the hills. That day gave me my seat as headman, but left scars far deeper than the flesh. _pause_ I am being rude talking about myself, my name is Ralegor, it is nice to finally meet Ilboc, Berresor, and Jarlmagnus. I have heard many great things about you. It surprises me that you did not make it into the mercenaries."__

The party will tell him all of what they know.

__"I was so afraid the first rumors of this were just false. Some years ago a little girl had come and told me a similar story about her brother, but I had no way to believe her in that her brother had been accepted into the mercenaries. That little girl later was lost to the woods, supposedly set off into the forest looking for something. Years went by with no other incidences so I wrote it off."__

He is remorseful and worried.

__"How can I help? How do I help?"__ Ralegor mutters to himself.

__"Here is the problem, the mercenaries are integral to our society. Most of our trade comes from them, I had always wondered why the prices were so low for goods. The boys and girls are so much better off striving for the mercenaries though, what a shame. We cannot let this continue. I will send out a letter to all the families to pull their children out for reasons other than the treachery. Unless you have another plan? They are very powerful, far more then anyone on this island. If your plan is to take them on, you better figure out how we acquire the airships to barter trade ourselves. There is another matter I must speak with you about."__

\page 

Ralegor grabs his shoulder an winces in pain. __"It is the stirges you see. They have gotten very strong in the Yeshin mountains to the north, if we dont make a trek up there to fight their numbers down they will raid the village like so many years ago. I have done this job every few years myself, but in the last few years I have been too busy, too old, and too tired. I have a great gift for you to help you fight back against the mercenaries."__ He points to the statue, most specifically the armor and weapons he once used.

He marks the path on your map clear as day to the tunnel enterance at the base of the mountains that leads to a long windy dirt path up the mountainside.

> The party should ready themselves.

### The Hermit in the Road

A human hermit is in your path. He is waving incense into the wind and chanting to the crows that fly near him. He is in an unbroken trance and pays no attention to any words you say.

<img

style='height:340px' />

He suddenly bursts out of it and says. (With intensity)

__"The great rusted arches in the north are the symbol of a gluttonous society. The great golden arches are praised for prosperity. Many have done so, many have given offerings of armor and weapon and shield and candle and flower, but they do not realize the truth of the arches. The arches may have been a means to the end of ancient humans. You should go. NOW!"__

Just as quickly as he exits his trance he enters back into it.


### Take Out the Stirges

You wind up into the mountains for the better part of the day and reach a cave roughly in the location you were told to look for Stirges. Unfortunately for you, he didnt really specify anything about the cave.

The party enters the cave and finds a corpse of a human nomad, dead by impalement with no visible weapon nearby.
The path with have a few stirges to dispatch:

* Minor Stirge Assasin
* Brutal Stirge Defender
* Standard Stirge Synergist

__"I see the stirges killed one of those men. They are a sad lot. All they are is lost fragments of a society long lost and decimated. They have valued insight though, I wonder what this one has on him."__

Searching the dead nomad you discover a heavily cracked black panelled square artifact with a chipped apple on the back.
Anyone else will find a pen with the letters B I and C under some mud.

__"I wonder if this is worth anything? It doesnt seem to do anything...what do you think we should do with it?"__

The cave will quickly end and only a small crawl space near the ceiling seems to be the only way into the what is presumably the stirge den.
(Once the adventures figure out a way in) the cave will be narrow for only a hundred feet or so.

- The cavern is gorgeous blue with razor sharp shards of glass like rock jutting out.
- In the center of the cave there is a glowing green colored sphere, possibly a cocoon.
- You can clearly see hundreds of stirge sacks with dormant stirges in them.

> There will be a probability that you step into sticky goo and a probability to break loose. If the timer runs out you will be stuck there through combat. Once all party members have been stuck once, or the timer runs out the next step occurs.


Upon moving closer to the cocoon, the queen will sweep around the corner to find her intruders

* Superior Queen Stirge
* Minor Stirge Sharpshooter
* Minor Stirge Defender

### The Ice Dragon of Dhallmor
Upon finishing the fight, the stirges surrounding you stay dormant and something must be decided about what to do with the centralized glowing green sphere.

You hear the sound of air being pushed away in waves from the back cavern. The cavern grows swiftly cold and the stirge sacks begin to freeze over.
Upon investigating the source of the cold you will find a calm and barely moving ice dragon who pays no mind to you.

The dragon will not respond to your requests, but he/she is magnificent to see. Hardly a sight to believe.
