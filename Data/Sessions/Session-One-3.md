# Those Damned Double Arches

### The Walled Citadel of Thatelch Delve

The wall is far more impressive in person than in stories. The wall is perfectly carved out of mountain and the entryway is simply massive.

You approach the wall with little caution as there is nothing nearby and turning the corner to see what is inside the opening you simply see stairs, clearly you can see down them about 30 flights.

There is a guardian of some sort standing stoic and unmoving.

Attempting to get close will cause the guardian to ready himself.

* Superior Sentinel Synergist

Upon defeating him you will find a strange looking key with odd writing.

The door opens with surprisingly little effort after using the key. The citadel smells like death and decay.

> The inhabitants of this citadel will be Undead Dwarves with an Undead King Spectre (Superior Synergist) who will not divulge any lore. There will be 3-5 treasures where appropriate.

* Minor Undead Dwarf (kit)
* Many other kits to be rolled on the encounter chart, d20, then lower as you go
* Incorporate Demonic Shifting Stone Statues
* Introduce Traps and Puzzles where possible

> Thum will be a well crafted masterwork dwarven blade, clearly worth a great deal, if no one goes for it Adel'rah definitely will, and Thum will be born again

> The King does not understand there is evidence of internal collapse in the dwarven society. 

_Sprinkle the ruins with evidence of vampirism_ 
* Bite wounds on the strongest foes
* Enemies emerging from the darkest places
* Notes with tales of the dark eve
* A handful of elvish undead 
* Skeletons, 

Note 1: In Elvish: If you find this we are fallen to an evil curse. There are brothers fighting brothers and in my hiding I must confess I dont want to die. Send my love to Thumin if you find him, if he is not already dead.

Note 2: In Elvish: Mostly illegible, ...thank you for coming to our aid, the dwarves will be forever gratful for the elves if you can somehow save us... but if not I would like to make sure whoever finds this knows we made a grave mistake opening the tunnel....if only we hadnt....cursed forever... there are blood splatters on the page as the writing suddenly stops.

Note 3: In Dwarvish: Durorgad (Du-ror-god), You were right it was the king, the king did this to us all by pushing us to keep digging for some ancient materials... we dug too deep and found the stone statues. We should have never brought them here. Those human statues cursed us. Damn the king for his ignoring of my warnings, he will pay and you will rule in his stead.

You find a cavern that goes deep in the earth, going in will shortly discover the cavern has been purposely blocked off with heavy dense stones.

Meta: The party can brainstorm what these statues really are in the real world context, whatever they are, they will fight them

__"Elves, you retched elves cursed us, destroyed us all. There will be no blood sparred this eve as I rip your flesh off your bones."__ -Spectre King

The King will turn aside your reasoning and pass it off as elven tricks, in his anger he simply attacks you.

## Reaching the Arches
You finally reach the religious sanctuary of the double arches. This is the largest human artifact site on Dhallmor. The golden arches, faded yellow and brittle, is mostly buried in the ground. It has wilted flowers on it, strange offerings like cups and now rotten food. This place has not been visited it quite some time, but it certainly has what you came for.

> Each roll on the treasure chart for level 5

## On Travelling Home
You take the long and slow walk home with your new found equipment. You discuss a story from your past that helps define your fighting style.

> Party should come up with character developing backstory on the fly and document it.

"There is no way those unborn stirges could be this large already, they take years to grow full size like this." says Adel'rah.

As you traverse the familiar passage you see several stirges coming out of the cave you went in before. Dispatch them.
