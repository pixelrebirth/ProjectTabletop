Asking villgers around near Lezumrim home in Sylbaran you quickly discover there is a house medani outpost just outside of town.

Sylbaran is a small town in the southern Eldeen Reaches, on the border of Droaam. It's position on the western tip of Silver Lake and its good soil make it ideal farm land. Its proximity to the monster nation and the harpy-infested Byeshk Mountains keep it from realizing its full potential though.

You find it surprisingly easy to enter into House Medani now that you are marked. You are welcomed, and asked your first names. Inside House Medani there is friendly banter and plenty of laughter. Asking around you find that the best person to talk to about getting work and money is Neva Ambrose.

Talking to Neva throws you a bit, she says to call herself "The Red Sash" ... The Red Sash's costume consists of a black tricorn hat, hair tucked into a headscarf mask, satin blouse, trousers, overcoat, and riding boots. Clad in black from head to foot, save for a red sash holding a rapier at her waist, she stands in profile-mysterious and forbidding.

In a slow rasping voice: "Who are you? Let me tell you straight that if you serve Breland, you will find your life lacks longevity."

She already had no love for the crown because of the stiff taxes placed on the neighborhood businesses, including her father's tavern. But she swore her revenge when her young beau was drafted into the king's service and died under the command of some foppish gentleman who ordered him on an unwarranted adventure. Now she rides the King's Road, exacting a bloody toll on agents of the crown. She periodically switches mounts, so she can't be identified by her horse.

"Let me tell you how you can help, you see that woman over there, her name is Palposu, she is a changeling, a flirt, and supposedly a Emerald Claw double agent. I need her dealt with, if she is who she claims, she may be an ally in finding out more about them. If she is a false double agent, we may be in serious trouble with her. Talk to Rithand and Thigraki about her to find out more. Do this and I will send a letter to the Baron to get you more visibility."

"and if you see fit to kill any corrupted brelish army personel on the way I would be grateful..."

<it is common knowledge that Breland is a very good and strong powered country, she is the criminal, but for justified reason>

Rithand is very hurt and depressed. He is repetative that she is a betrayer, but it is obvious he is hurt. He explains his side of the story:
Palposu pretended to love him to steal secrets from house medani, she admitted the fact she was an agent and that she was really in love with Thigraki.

Thigraki is very proud to have a woman of many fancies. He most definitely believes her and is madly entranced by her changing beauty. He believes Rithand to be dangerous to her.

Palposu will defend herself and say she is telling the truth. She will divulge information about her drop point and suggested we pursue it to show she is actually telling the truth.
The woman you are after is named Lana the Peace Bringer, an agent of the Emerald Claw. She swears the information she has divulged to them has been false.

Her next drop is in two days, where she admits she doesnt want to go. She fears Lana is on to her and will kill her.

He claims the half-elf is wicked and cruel. A warlord on a self-righteous crusade to provide Emerald Claw protection at all costs, mostly death.
Lana is a crime lord and frequents the Frinan's Delve as a hub for her criminal activity.

This walled castle has strong stone walls with towers. It appears deserted, but is inhabited by marauders led most likely by Lana the Peace Bringer

dungeon: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/84/bf/9584bf69a6355350ab3133100e1525c0.jpg
There is no magic here, which is odd. The doors are open and stuck that way. There are no patrols outside.

Upon fighting you way through traps and monsters, you will find Lana is screaming at a red headed dwarf is front of a mirror.. yelling that he is pathetic, and worthless... he is paralyzed with fear as he looks at the mirror.
She slams his head into the mirror and knocks him out cold. She proclaims, kindly all of a sudden, that he was not worth protecting anymore.

"He has no reason to live if he is afraid of mirrors. I will deal with him later, who are you? Do you come for protection? You will need it now."

Granter: 
    Information on the Emerald Claw (VERY LOW POSSIBILITY)
    Information on Palposu (One way, she will ease off, the other she will attack her more aggressively)
    Slips information on the corrupt officials in the city (Murasra)
Petitioner: 
    Information on House Medani
    Asks if you will neal to the Emerald Claw, she will trap you in the room either way

She is twisted into believing the Emerald Claw is the ultimate organization and oppose all that are not members.
She simply walks past them as she speaks and thanks them for cleaning up the rabble she has been meaning to in the castle. Attempts to stop her will result in a hold spell.

By looking to a way out, you will find a secret panel with treasure in it.

You will find a series of scratches in the book shelf that read \The walls listen\
Runes are carved into the side of the stone wall> A rowan tree withers and dies. (dc 20)

Eventually you will find a door: Section of wall pivots open when a command word is spoken

There is no sign of Lana the Peace Bringer.
