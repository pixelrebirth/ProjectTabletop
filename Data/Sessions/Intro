You look behind you to see the cavern collapsing. Startled, you run as swiftly as possible to escape the crushing rocks. You barely make it out alive as the cave closes on itself. It would seem this treasure may not be worth your lives, you will simply have to inform Lezumrin that the treasure cannot be retreived. He may very well have a reward for your heroic attempt at getting the staff he requested. The traps in the cavern were just as deadly as he had mentioned.

Upon getting back to town, the party find that no one is answering the door to Lezumrin's home. Finding that odd for the time of night you arrived, the party decides it is best to break into the home to see if he is alright. 

Once the party enters the house a deep fog enters your mind, a cloudy vision, a numbing sense of touch, a deafening of sound.. you push on, having felt no pain you assume it is temporary. On the top level of the house you find Lezumrin staring at a table, almost in a trance. Once he sees you his shape changes very briefly to that of a dragons head.

When you speak to him, he breaks his trance and the fog in your mind shifts to seeing the world from a thousand feet high. The city, the country around, and all living things are frozen solid. Just as fast as you can tell what is happening, the ice catches fire, the earth ripples, and the trees instantly wilt like a dieing flower. The ground splits deep within the earth and a ear splitting shreik is released. A balrog and hordes of fiends emerge decimating all the land around you.

You suddenly awake with a burn on your body, upon investigating you have a new, unfamiliar mark on you. Lezumrin apologies in the kindest of tones.

"I apologize for having to show you this, but you all are the chosen. I could not show this to just anyone, your quest to find my staff was a setup. Prophecy claimed that a party would succeed in surviving the hunt would be gifted a dragons gift. I did not realize it would occur so quickly. My kind does not tread lightly on the matters of Prophecy, you have earned your dragon mark and are now identifiable to House Medani. For those who ask you are the great descendants of Forthvin d'Medani. He is a missing legend among the house and you will do well to keep myself and your vision a secret.

I need you to investigate the vision you saw, it is a flash of prophecy I do not fully understand, but it cannot come to pass. Start by seeking your house and gaining rank among them. You have been placed in house Medani very strategically, as they are the secretive agents of Khorvaire. You will find far deeper information about the evil you saw there.

I am sure you have questions but now is not the time. I brought you a horde of my riches, there will be more.

Suddenly Lezumrin is gone and on his table is a key. But what does the key go to?
