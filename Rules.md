# Nanolite
Take Dnd, but lose the rule books. Microlite20 inspired Nanolite is an incredibly easy role playing game.
The rules are heavily based on Eberron and what I saw Eberron being about, namely swashbuckling and magic heavy.

## Races
Races are simple in Nanolite, all the information you need is on the following table.

|Race|Effect|Eberron Relevance|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----|
|Warforged|AC+2|
|Human|HEROISM+2|
|Half-Orc|CMBase+2|
|Changeling|SpellCM+2|
|Shifter|PHYS+2|
|Half-Elf|SUB+2|
|Aerenal Elf|KNOW+2|
|Valenar Elf|SURV+2|
|Gnome|COMM+2|
|Dwarf|STR+2|
|Halfling|DEX+2|
|Kalashtar|MIND+2|

## Classless
There are none. Classes can cause odd identity riffs with players. 
We found in developing the game that having a classless system really focused our energy on defining oneself by ones' actions.
We believe ones actions make who you are, not what you are told you are

## Building a Character
### Stats
Setting stats at level 1 is simple, STR/DEX/MIND start with the values 12/14/16 and the points can be redistributed down to 10 and up to 18.
Having a good balance between stats goes a long way to having a complete character. Every stat has monumental effect on your character.

Example: STR 11 DEX 18 MIND 13
The sum of the numbers should be 42.

You will gain another skill point every EVEN level.

|Stat|Directly Effects|
|-----|-----|
|STR|HP, MELEE DAMAGE, MELEE %, MELEE CM, SR|
|DEX|AC, RANGED DAMAGE, RANGED %, RANGED CM, SR|
|MIND|SPELL %, Spell CM, SR|

### Skills

All skills are set to the level your character is at, there are other modifiers like equipment or ability that can modify this beyond the level amount. The skills are:

* PHYS - Physical
* SUB  - Subterfuge
* KNOW - Knowledge
* COMM - Communication
* SURV - Survival

### Vise/Virtue:
Choose one Stat and one Skill to be your Vise (-2) and Virtue (+2) 

Example:

* STR/KNOW as a Virtue (gives +2 to each)
* MIND/COMM as a Vise (gives -2 to each)

### Set stat modifiers
* STRMOD: (STR - 10) / 2 round down
* DEXMOD: (DEX - 10) / 2 round down
* MINDMOD: (MIND - 10) / 2 round down

### Hit Points, Armor Class (AC), Spell Resistance (SR), Heroism
* HP: STR + 6/level
* AC: DEXMOD + Armor + Shield
* SR: STRMOD + DEXMOD + MINDMOD + 10
* HEROISM: level


### Melee and Ranged damage
Damage is determined by your stats. We realized people would just take a Greatsword because it did the most damage, not because it fit the character they were building.

There are three classes of melee weapons, two-handed, single-handed, and side arm. Of them, a single primary and secondary weapon can be chosen. The secondary should be a side arm type @ str minus 2 (see below). The weapons, remember, are purely aesthetic and a creative element to your character.

Damage is determined by taking the correlated stat score, looking at the roll chart below and locating the amount of melee/ranged damage you can do.

Ex.
At level 2 with STR and DEX both at 3, you could get say:

|Slot|Weapon|Damage|Combat Modifier|
|-|-|-|-|
|Primary Melee|Rapier|2d4|+5|
|Secondary Melee|Dagger|1d4|+3|
|Ranged|Shortbow|2d4|+5|

### Combat Modifiers
You will notice combat modifier in the table above, this is added statically to your damage when you roll.
To calculate Combat Modifier (CM) you do:

|CM Slot|CM Calculation|
|-|-|
Primary Melee|STR + Level
Secondary Melee|STR + Level - 2
Ranged|DEX + Level
Spells (SCM)|MIND + Level

### Spell Combat Modifier
Spell Combat Modifier (SCM) is a different stat because it is affected slightly differently in the system. More on that later.

### Armor
Armor is what counters Melee and Ranged Combat Rolls.

Armor total is Armor + Shields + DEX
Armor can be bought, found or stolen. Whatever it may be it should have a range of 1-9 for balance sake. Shields also can give you armor bonus.

Splint Mail - 6 for example would give you 6 armor.
Small Shield - 2 would be 2 armor bonus

Armor has a direct correlation with failure percentages, meaning if you have a armor with 6 and a shield with 2, you will have 8% higher failure rate on melee, ranged and spells. This offers some level of balance for tank style characters. (more on failure rates later)

### Spell Resist
Spell resistance is what counters Spell Combat Rolls and is calculated at (10 + STR + DEX + MIND)
