# Nanolite
Take Dnd, but lose the rule books. Microlite20 inspired Nanolite is an incredibly easy role playing game.
The rules are heavily based on Eberron and what I saw Eberron being about, namely swashbuckling and magic heavy.

## Races
Races are simple in Nanolite, all the information you need is on the following table.
For other systems, simple change the name Human into Spaghetti Monster (or whatever you want)

|Race|Effect|Lore Relevance|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----|
|Warforged|AC+2|
|Human|HEROISM+2|
|Half-Orc|CMBase+2|
|Changeling|SpellCM+2|
|Shifter|PHYS+2|
|Half-Elf|SUB+2|
|Aerenal Elf|KNOW+2|
|Valenar Elf|SURV+2|
|Gnome|COMM+2|
|Dwarf|STR+2|
|Halfling|DEX+2|
|Kalashtar|MIND+2|

## Classless
There are none. Classes can cause odd identity riffs with players. 
We found in developing the game that having a classless system really focused our energy on defining oneself by ones' actions. We believe ones actions make who you are, not what you are told you are.

## Building a Character
### Stats
Stats are derived from a point system. At level 1 you start with 16 points. Each point costs as much as the spoint you are trying to achieve. You must assign this to each of the stats STR/DEX/MIND.

Ex. from 0 to 1 STR would cost 1 point, from 5 to 6 STR would cost 6 points more.

At first level. if you want an STR of 4, it will cost a total of 10 points, leaving you just 4 points for dex and mind.

|Stat|Point Cost|
|-----|-----|
|1|1|
|2|3|
|3|6|
|4|10|
|5|15|
|6|21|
|7|28|
|8|36|
|9|45|
|10|55|

When leveling up, if you have a str of 5 and want to make it 6 you need to have 6 points to spend, you can save them between levels. You will get 2 points to spend per level and start at 16.

Stat Direct Effect:

|Stat|Directly Effects|
|-----|-----|
|STR|HP, MELEE DAMAGE, MELEE %, MELEE CM, SR|
|DEX|AC, RANGED DAMAGE, RANGED %, RANGED CM, SR|
|MIND|SPELL %, Spell CM, SR|

### Skills

All skills are set to the level your character is at, there are other modifiers like equipment or abilities that can modify this beyond the level amount. The skills are:

* PHYS - Physical
* SUB  - Subterfuge
* KNOW - Knowledge
* COMM - Communication
* SURV - Survival

### Vise/Virtue:
Choose one Stat and one Skill to be your Vise (-1) and Virtue (+1) 

Example:

* STR/KNOW as a Virtue (gives +1 to each)
* MIND/COMM as a Vise (gives -1 to each)

### Hit Points, Armor Class (AC), Spell Resistance (SR), Heroism
* HP: STR * 5 + 6/level
* AC: DEX + Armor + Shield + 10
* SR: STR + DEX + MIND + 10
* HEROISM: level

### Melee and Ranged damage
Damage is determined by taking the correlated stat score, looking at the roll chart below and locating the amound of melee/ranged damage you can do.
