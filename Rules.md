# Nanolite
Take Dnd, but lose the rule books. Microlite20 inspired Nanolite is an incredibly easy role playing game.
The rules are heavily based on Eberron and what I saw Eberron being about, namely swashbuckling and magic heavy.

## Races
Races are simple in Nanolite, all the information you need is on the following table.

|Race|Effect|Eberron Relevance|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----|
|Warforged|AC+2|
|Human|HEROISM+2|
|Half-Orc|CMBase+2|
|Changeling|SpellCM+2|
|Shifter|PHYS+2|
|Half-Elf|SUB+2|
|Aerenal Elf|KNOW+2|
|Valenar Elf|SURV+2|
|Gnome|COMM+2|
|Dwarf|STR+2|
|Halfling|DEX+2|
|Kalashtar|MIND+2|

## Classless
There are none. Classes can cause odd identity riffs with players. 
We found in developing the game the having a classless system really focused our energy on defining oneself by ones' actions. We believe ones actions make who you are, not what you are told you are
