# Nanolite
Take Dnd, but lose the rule books. Microlite20 inspired Nanolite is an incredibly easy role playing game.
The rules are heavily based on Eberron and what I saw Eberron being about, namely swashbuckling and magic heavy.

## Upbringing
Upbringing is like races in most systems, all the information you need is on the following table.

|Upbringing|Effect|Lore Relevance|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----|
|Body Hardened|AC+2|
|Heroic|HEROISM+2|
|Combat Grown|CMBase+2|
|Magic Infused|SpellCM+2|
|Athletic|PHYS+2|
|Sneaky|SUB+2|
|Well Read|KNOW+2|
|Survivalist|SURV+2|
|Well Spoken|COMM+2|
|Weight Trained|STR+2|
|Flexible|DEX+2|
|Intelligent|MIND+2|

## Races
Races are intended to be purely aesthetic and creative, this is also how we can use any system.
We found in developing the game that having a race as an aesthetic element people would make more thoughtful choices on race.

For example people would not take a half-orc simply because they wanted +2 strength, they could take an elf with Weight Training. Now you have a far more creative super buff elf, rather then a half-orc for strength sake.

## Classless
There are none. Classes can cause odd identity riffs with players. 
We found in developing the game that having a classless system really focused our energy on defining oneself by ones' actions. We believe ones actions make who you are, not what you are told you are.

## Building a Character
### Stats
Stats are derived from a point system. At level 1 you start with 16 points. Each point costs as much as the stat point you are trying to achieve. You must assign this to each of the stats STR/DEX/MIND.

Ex. from 0 to 1 STR would cost 1 point, from 5 to 6 STR would cost 6 points more.

At first level. if you want an STR of 4, it will cost a total of 10 points, leaving you just 4 points for dex and mind.

|Stat|Point cost from level 1|
|-----|-----|
|1|1|
|2|3|
|3|6|
|4|10|
|5|15|
|6|21|
|7|28|
|8|36|
|9|45|
|10|55|

When leveling up, if you have a str of 5 and want to make it 6 you need to have 6 points to spend, you can save them between levels. You will get 2 points to spend per level and start at 16.

|Stat|Directly Effects|
|-----|-----|
|STR|HP, MELEE DAMAGE, MELEE %, MELEE CM, SR|
|DEX|AC, RANGED DAMAGE, RANGED %, RANGED CM, SR|
|MIND|SPELL %, Spell CM, SR|

### Skills

All skills are set to the level your character is at, there are other modifiers like equipment or abilities that can modify this beyond the level amount. The skills are:

* PHYS - Physical
* SUB  - Subterfuge
* KNOW - Knowledge
* COMM - Communication
* SURV - Survival

### Vise/Virtue:
Choose one Stat and one Skill to be your Vise (-1) and Virtue (+1) 

Example:

* STR/KNOW as a Virtue (gives +1 to each)
* MIND/COMM as a Vise (gives -1 to each)

### Hit Points, Armor Class (AC), Spell Resistance (SR), Heroism
* HP: STR * 5 + 6/level
* AC: DEX + Armor + Shield + 10
* SR: STR + DEX + MIND + 10
* HEROISM: level

### Melee and Ranged damage
Damage is determined by your stats. We realized people would just take a Greatsword because it did the most damage, not because it fit the character they were building.

There are three classes of melee weapons, two-handed, single-handed, and side arm. Of them, a single primary and secondary weapon can be chosen. The secondary should be a side arm type @ str minus 2 (see below). The weapons, remember, are purely aesthetic and a creative element to your character.

Damage is determined by taking the correlated stat score, looking at the roll chart below and locating the amount of melee/ranged damage you can do.

Ex.
At level 2 with STR and DEX both at 3, you could get say:

|Slot|Weapon|Damage|Combat Modifier|
|-|-|-|-|
|Primary Melee|Rapier|2d4|+5|
|Secondary Melee|Dagger|1d4|+3|
|Ranged|Shortbow|2d4|+5|

### Combat Modifiers
You will notice combat modifier in the table above, this is added statically to your damage when you roll.
To calculate Combat Modifier (CM) you do:

|CM Slot|CM Calculation|
|-|-|
Primary Melee|STR + Level
Secondary Melee|STR + Level - 2
Ranged|DEX + Level
Spells (SCM)|MIND + Level

### Spell Combat Modifier
Spell Combat Modifier (SCM) is a different stat because it is affected slightly differently in the system. More on that later.

### Armor
Armor is what counters Melee and Ranged Combat Rolls.

Armor total is Armor + Shields + DEX
Armor can be bought, found or stolen. Whatever it may be it should have a range of 1-9 for balance sake. Shields also can give you armor bonus.

Splint Mail - 6 for example would give you 6 armor.
Small Shield - 2 would be 2 armor bonus

Armor has a direct correlation with failure percentages, meaning if you have a armor with 6 and a shield with 2, you will have 8% higher failure rate on melee, ranged and spells. This offers some level of balance for tank style characters. (more on failure rates later)

### Spell Resist
Spell resistance is what counters Spell Combat Rolls and is calculated at (10 + STR + DEX + MIND)
