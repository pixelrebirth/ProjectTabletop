# Nanolite
Take Dnd, but lose the rule books. Microlite20 inspired Nanolite is an incredibly easy role playing game.
The rules are heavily based on Eberron and what I saw Eberron being about, namely swashbuckling and magic heavy.

## Upbringing
Upbringing is like races in most systems, all the information you need is on the following table.

|Upbringing|Effect|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----|
|Body Hardened|MD+2|
|Dodgy|RD+2|
|Spell Hardened|SD+2|
|Heroic|HEROISM+2|
|Melee Trained|MeleeCM+2|
|Range Trained|RandedCM+2|
|Spell Trained|SpellCM+2|
|Weight Lifting|STR+2|
|Flexible|DEX+2|
|Intelligent|MIND+2|

## Races
Races are intended to be purely aesthetic and creative, this is also how we can use any system.
We found in developing the game that having a race as an aesthetic element people would make more thoughtful choices on race.

For example people would not take a half-orc simply because they wanted +2 strength, they could take an elf with Weight Training.
Now you have a far more creative super buff elf, rather then a half-orc for strength sake.

## Classless
There are none. Classes can cause odd identity riffs with players. 
We found in developing the game that having a classless system really focused our energy on defining oneself by ones' actions. We believe ones actions make who you are, not what you are told you are.

## Building a Character
### Stats
Setting stats at level 1 is simple, STR/DEX/MIND start with the value 3.
Every level you get a point to spend

|Stat|Directly Effects|
|-----|-----|
|STR|MELEE DAMAGE, MELEE %, MELEE CM, MD|
|DEX|RANGED DAMAGE, RANGED %, RANGED CM, RD|
|MIND|SPELL DAMAGE, SPELL %, Spell CM, SD|

### Health, Defenses, Heroism
* (Health) HT: 6/level
* (Melee Defense) MD: STR + Armor + Shield
* (Ranged Defense) RD: DEX + Armor + Shield
* (Spell Defense) SD: MIND + Armor + Shield
* HEROISM: level

### Melee and Ranged damage
Damage is determined by your stats. We realized people would just take a Greatsword because it did the most damage, not because it fit the character they were building.

There are three types of melee weapons, two-handed, single-handed, and side arm. Of them, a single primary and secondary weapon can be chosen. 
The secondary should be a side arm type @ str minus 2 (see below). The weapons, remember, are purely aesthetic and a creative element to your character.

Damage is determined by taking the correlated stat score, looking at the roll chart below and locating the amount of melee/ranged damage you can do.

Ex.
At level 2 with STR and DEX both at 3, you could get say:

|Slot|Weapon|Damage|Combat Modifier|
|-|-|-|-|
|Primary Melee|Rapier|2d4|+5|
|Secondary Melee|Dagger|1d4|+3|
|Ranged|Shortbow|2d4|+5|

### Combat Modifiers
You will notice combat modifier in the table above, this is added statically to your damage when you roll.
To calculate Combat Modifier (CM) you do:

|CM Slot|CM Calculation|
|-|-|
Melee|STR
SideArm Melee|STR - 2
Ranged|DEX
Spells|MIND

|CM Slot|CM Calculation|
|-|-|
Primary Melee|STR + Level
Secondary Melee|STR + Level - 2
Ranged|DEX + Level
Spells (SCM)|MIND + Level

### Spell Combat Modifier
Spell Combat Modifier (SCM) is a different stat because it is affected slightly differently in the system. More on that later.

### Armor
Armor is what counters Melee and Ranged Combat Rolls.

Armor total is Armor + Shields + DEX
Armor can be bought, found or stolen. Whatever it may be it should have a range of 1-9 for balance sake. Shields also can give you armor bonus.

Splint Mail - 6 for example would give you 6 armor.
Small Shield - 2 would be 2 armor bonus

Armor has a direct correlation with failure percentages, meaning if you have a armor with 6 and a shield with 2, you will have 8% higher failure rate on melee, ranged and spells. This offers some level of balance for tank style characters. (more on failure rates later)

### Spell Resist
Spell resistance is what counters Spell Combat Rolls and is calculated at (10 + STR + DEX + MIND)
